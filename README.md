## About The Project

### <strong>1째 Cleaning the data</strong>

The first step was to clean the data by dealing with null values from the database.
Generating the files wine 130k.csv and wines.csv with the clean data in the 2-Data folder.

### <strong>2째 Analyzing geographic data</strong>

I wanted to analyze by continent too so include this in the data table generating the wines_geo.csv file.

### <strong>3째 Generating the recommendation by points</strong>

So, doing some analysis, I recommend some wines based on their score.
